# Prepare new host
This is my script (or collection) to create/prepare new host for my usage.

I don't know if other people can do anything with it, but at least it should serve my purpouse.

1. Install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS server, as minimal install as possible. Select only OpenSSH Server.
2. Create normal user on installation process.

... Maybe I should create script for bootstrap whole base installation process?
